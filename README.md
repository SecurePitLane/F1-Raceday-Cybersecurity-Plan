This project outlines a cybersecurity strategy for protecting a Formula One team’s critical systems and data during a Grand Prix weekend.

## 🧠 Scenario

Imagine you’re the lead cybersecurity tech for an F1 team. Your job is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all systems across:

- Garage networks and telemetry data
- Team radio and communication systems
- Trackside Wi-Fi and mobile setups
- Pit wall and engineering control rooms
- Cloud services (remote strategy, file sync)

## 🔐 Threats Considered

- Man-in-the-middle attacks on telemetry data
- Spoofed team communications
- Insider threats within the garage or paddock
- Unpatched devices on Wi-Fi
- Social engineering targeting pit crew or media

## 🛠️ Tools & Measures

| Area | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Device Hardening | Enforce 2FA, biometric access, remote wipe |
| Network Security | Use segmented VLANs, VPN tunnels, encrypted Wi-Fi |
| Real-time Monitoring | SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel), IDS/IPS alerts |
| Physical Security | Secure devices in paddock, no USB policy |
| Communication | Encrypted radios, end-to-end mobile comms |

## 🧩 Bonus Ideas

- Simulate network topology of the garage and pit wall
- Draft fake phishing email targeted at a team engineer
- Write up a post-race security audit checklist

## 📌 Why This Matters

Formula One teams move **massive volumes of data in real time**, making them high-value targets for cyberattacks. This plan is a personal exercise in thinking like an F1 security analyst.
